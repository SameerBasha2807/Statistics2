Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test.
t-test:

A t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically 
𝑛
<
30
n<30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown. It uses the t-distribution, which has heavier tails than the normal distribution, making it more appropriate for smaller samples.
Example Scenario for t-test:

Comparing the average test scores of students in two different classes where the number of students in each class is less than 30, and the population standard deviation is unknown.
z-test:

A z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically 
𝑛
≥
30
n≥30) and when the population standard deviation is known. It uses the standard normal distribution (z-distribution).
Example Scenario for z-test:

Comparing the average height of a large sample of men to a known population mean when the population standard deviation is known.

Q2:
One-tailed Test:

A one-tailed test assesses whether a sample mean is significantly greater than or less than a population mean in a specific direction. It is used when the research hypothesis specifies a direction of the effect.
Example:

Testing whether a new drug increases blood pressure. The hypothesis is that the drug leads to an increase (greater than).
Two-tailed Test:

A two-tailed test assesses whether a sample mean is significantly different from a population mean, in either direction (greater than or less than). It is used when the research hypothesis does not specify a direction.
Example:

Testing whether a new drug affects blood pressure, without specifying whether it increases or decreases it.

Q3: 
Type 1 Error:

A Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true. This is also known as a "false positive."
Example:

A researcher concludes that a new drug is effective in lowering blood pressure when, in reality, it is not (the null hypothesis that the drug has no effect is true).
Type 2 Error:

A Type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false. This is also known as a "false negative."
Example:

A researcher concludes that a new drug is not effective in lowering blood pressure when, in reality, it is (the null hypothesis is false, but the researcher fails to reject it).

Q4: 
Bayes's Theorem:

Bayes's Theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It combines prior knowledge with new data to make more accurate predictions.
Formula:

𝑃
(
𝐴
∣
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐵
∣
𝐴
)
×
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(A∣B)= 
P(B)
P(B∣A)×P(A)
​
 
where:

𝑃
(
𝐴
∣
𝐵
)
P(A∣B) is the probability of event 
𝐴
A occurring given that 
𝐵
B is true.
𝑃
(
𝐵
∣
𝐴
)
P(B∣A) is the probability of event 
𝐵
B occurring given that 
𝐴
A is true.
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
P(A) is the prior probability of event 
𝐴
A.
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(B) is the total probability of event 
𝐵
B.
Example:

Suppose a doctor knows that 1% of the population has a certain disease (P(Disease) = 0.01). A test for the disease is 99% accurate (P(Test Positive | Disease) = 0.99), but it also has a 5% false positive rate (P(Test Positive | No Disease) = 0.05). If a patient tests positive, Bayes's Theorem can be used to update the probability that the patient actually has the disease.

Q5:
Confidence Interval:

A confidence interval is a range of values, derived from the sample data, that is likely to contain the population parameter (e.g., mean) with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95%).
Formula:
For the mean:

Confidence Interval

𝑋

Confidence Interval=

Z 
α/2
​
  = z-value corresponding to the desired confidence level
𝜎
σ = population standard deviation
𝑛
n = sample size
Example:

Suppose a sample of 50 students has an average test score of 70 with a standard deviation of 10. To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean:
Confidence Interval
=
70
±
1.96
×
10
50
=
70
±
2.77
Confidence Interval=70±1.96× 
50
​
 
10
​
 =70±2.77
So, the 95% confidence interval is (67.23, 72.77).

Q6. 
Sample Problem:

A certain disease affects 1% of a population. A diagnostic test is 95% accurate (i.e., it correctly identifies 95% of the cases) but also has a 2% false positive rate. If a person tests positive, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?
Solution:
Let:

𝑃
(
𝐷
)
P(D) = Probability of having the disease = 0.01
𝑃
(
¬
𝐷
)
P(¬D) = Probability of not having the disease = 0.99
𝑃
(
𝑇
∣
𝐷
)
P(T∣D) = Probability of testing positive given having the disease = 0.95
𝑃
(
𝑇
∣
¬
𝐷
)
P(T∣¬D) = Probability of testing positive given not having the disease = 0.02
Using Bayes's Theorem:

𝑃
(
𝐷
∣
𝑇
)
=
𝑃
(
𝑇
∣
𝐷
)
×
𝑃

)
𝑃

𝑇

)
+
𝑃
(
𝑇
∣
¬
𝐷
)
×
𝑃
(
¬
𝐷
)
P(D∣T)= 
P(T∣D)×P(D)+P(T∣¬D)×P(¬D)
P(T∣D)×P(D)
​
 

𝑃
(
𝐷
∣
𝑇
)
=
0.95
×
0.01
(
0.95
×

)
+
(
0.02
×
0.99
)
=
0.0095
0.0095
+
0.0198
=
0.324
P(D∣T)= 
(0.95×0.01)+(0.02×0.99)
0.95×0.01
​
 = 
0.0095+0.0198
0.0095
​
 =0.324
So, the probability that a person actually has the disease given a positive test result is approximately 32.4%.

Q7.

Given:
Sample mean (
𝑋
ˉ
X
ˉ
 ) = 50
Standard deviation (
𝜎
σ) = 5
Sample size (
𝑛
n) = Assume

30
n=30 for calculation
Z-value for 95% confidence (
𝑍
𝛼
/
2
Z 
α/2
​
 ) = 1.96
Using the formula for the confidence interval:

Confidence Interval
=
50
±
1.96
×
5
30
=
50
±
1.79
Confidence Interval=50±1.96× 
30
​
 
5
​
 =50±1.79
So, the 95% confidence interval is (48.21, 51.79). This means we are 95% confident that the true population mean lies within this interval.

Q8:
Margin of Error:

The margin of error is the amount added to and subtracted from the sample mean in a confidence interval. It reflects the uncertainty associated with the estimate.
Formula:

Margin of Error

𝜎
𝑛
Margin of Error=Z 
α/2
​
 × 
n
​
 
σ
​
 
Effect of Sample Size:

As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases because the standard error decreases.
Example:

Suppose a survey is conducted to estimate the average time spent on social media. With a sample size of 100, the margin of error might be ±3 minutes. Increasing the sample size to 1,000 might reduce the margin of error to ±1 minute, providing a more precise estimate.

Q9. Solution:

Given:
Data point (
𝑋
X) = 75
Population mean (

Interpretation:

A z-score of 1 indicates that the data point is 1 standard deviation above the mean.

Q10. 
Solution:

Null hypothesis (

H

​
 ): The drug is not effective, i.e., the mean weight loss is 0.
Alternative hypothesis (

H

​
 ): The drug is effective, i.e., the mean weight loss is greater than 0.
Given:

Population mean (

Degrees of freedom:

𝑓

−
1

−
1

49
df=n−1=50−1=49
Using a t-table or calculator, the critical value for 
𝑑
𝑓
=
49
df=49 at 95% confidence level (one-tailed) is approximately 1.677.

Since 16.97 > 1.677, we reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the drug is significantly effective at a 95% confidence level.
